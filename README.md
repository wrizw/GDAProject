# Cyclistic Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Cyclistic Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my data analysis journey using Cyclistic bike-sharing data in R. 

## About the Project

This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polishedâ€™: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program in Chicago. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis to answer key business questions, such as understanding user behavior and offering recommendations to increase annual membership conversions.

## Data Source and Period

The data used in this analysis can be found at [Cyclistic Data Source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It includes detailed information about bike rides taken in Chicago. The data used in this analysis covers a specific time frame, capturing bike-sharing activity in Chicago. The period for the data is from September 2022 to October 2023.

## Key Features - Analysis Step

- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and preprocessed the raw data, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explored and visualized the data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Descriptive Analysis:** Extracted statistical insights on ride durations and user behaviors.
- **Data Visualization:** Created informative visualizations to present key findings.
- **Business Recommendations:** Provided actionable recommendations to boost annual membership sales.

## How to Navigate

1. **Data Analysis:** Access the R scripts in the [Scripts](Scripts/) directory to review the code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Report:** Check the [Reports](Reports/) directory for a detailed analysis report and insights derived from the project.

## Key Findings

- Casual riders tend to have longer average ride lengths compared to members.
- Weekend rides are longer in duration than rides on weekdays.
- Cyclistic can consider targeting casual riders for potential membership conversion.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to improve Cyclistic's business:

1. Enhance the user experience for casual riders to convert them into annual members.
2. Optimize bike distribution based on ride patterns and locations.
3. Implement marketing campaigns during peak usage times to attract new users.
